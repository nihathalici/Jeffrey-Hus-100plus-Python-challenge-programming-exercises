Question 40

Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). 
Then the function needs to print all values except the first 5 elements in the list.

Hints:

Use ** operator to get power of a number. Use range() for loops. Use list.append() to add values into a list. Use [n1:n2] to slice a list

Consider the PEP 8 - Style Guide. Naming a class: PrintValue . Naming a method: print_value .
