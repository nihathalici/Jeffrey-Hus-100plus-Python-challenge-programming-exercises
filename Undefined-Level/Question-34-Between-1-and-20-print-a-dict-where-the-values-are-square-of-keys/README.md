Question 34

Define a function which can print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 
(both included) and the values are square of keys.

Hints:

Use dict[key]=value pattern to put entry into a dictionary. Use ** operator to get power of a number. Use range() for loops.

Consider the PEP 8 - Style Guide. Naming a class: PrintValue . Naming a method: print_value .
