Question 64

Write a program to compute 1/2+2/3+3/4+...+n/n+1 with a given n input by console (n>0).

Example: If the following n is given as input to the program:

5

Then, the output of the program should be:

3.55

In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Hints: Use float() to convert an integer to a float.

Solution:

```python
n = int(input("Enter a positive integer n: "))
sum_series = 0.0

for i in range(1, n+1):
    sum_series += i / (i + 1)

print(round(sum_series, 2))
```

Alternative Solution:

```python
n = int(input("Enter a positive integer n: "))
sum_series = 0.0

for k in range(1, n+1):
    term = k / (k + 1)
    sum_series += term

print(round(sum_series, 2))
```
